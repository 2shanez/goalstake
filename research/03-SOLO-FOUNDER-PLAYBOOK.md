## Pieter Levels (@levelsio)

### Profile
- Dutch developer, digital nomad
- Built multiple $1M+ ARR products solo
- Famous for "12 startups in 12 months" challenge (2014)
- Now runs: Nomad List, Remote OK, Photo AI, others

### Products & Revenue (Estimated)
| Product | ARR | Built In |

| Remote OK | $1M+ | 2015 |
| Photo AI | $2M+ | 2023 |
| Interior AI | $500K+ | 2023 |
| **Total** | **$4M+** | Solo |

### Philosophy

#### 1. Ship Fast, Fix Later
> "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."

- Launch in days, not months
- Real users > theoretical improvements
- Iterate based on feedback, not assumptions

#### 2. Build in Public
- Tweet progress daily
- Share revenue numbers
- Turn building into content
- Builds audience while building product

#### 3. No Venture Capital
- Self-funded from revenue
- 100% ownership
- No board meetings or runway pressure
- Can pivot or kill products freely

#### 4. Automation Over Hiring
- Automate everything possible
- One person can run multiple products
- AI tools amplify solo capabilities
- Hire contractors only when necessary

#### 5. Boring Technology
- PHP, jQuery, simple databases
- No complex frameworks
- Tech that one person can maintain
- Optimize for speed to market

### Tactical Lessons

**Landing Page First**
- Build landing page before product
- Collect emails to validate demand
- Launch to waitlist for day-one users

**Charge from Day One**
- Free products attract wrong users
- Payment = validation
- Even $5/month filters to serious users

**SEO as Distribution**
- Nomad List ranks for "best cities for digital nomads"
- Remote OK ranks for job searches
- Organic traffic = free acquisition

**Community as Moat**
- Nomad List has Slack community
- Users help users
- Network effects compound
