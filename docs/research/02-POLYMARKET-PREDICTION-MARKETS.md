## Lessons for GoalStake

### What to Emulate

1. **Simple UX**
   - Binary outcomes (hit goal / miss goal)
   - Clear stakes and payouts
   - No complex configuration

2. **Event Design**
   - Clear, verifiable outcomes
   - Time-bound (deadline)
   - Objective criteria

3. **Transparency**
   - On-chain settlement
   - Visible stakes and odds
   - Open verification logic

4. **Distribution**
   - Make outcomes shareable
   - Embed social proof
   - Viral loop: share goal → friends join → repeat

### What to Avoid

1. **Regulatory Landmines**
   - GoalStake = personal goals, not third-party outcomes
   - Not "gambling on others" — committing to yourself
   - Different legal framing

2. **Manipulation Risk**
   - GoalStake users can only stake on their own performance
   - Can't "whale" someone else's goal
   - Self-limiting by design

3. **Complexity**
   - Don't build prediction market infrastructure
   - Simple: stake → verify → settle
   - No trading, no market-making

## Competitive Positioning

| Feature | Polymarket | GoalStake |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| What you bet on | Others' outcomes | Your own goals |
| Verification | UMA oracle + manual | Chainlink + Strava |
| Legal framing | Prediction market | Commitment contract |
| Winner model | Buy low, sell high | Complete goal, earn |
| Complexity | Trading interface | Simple stake/join |
| Target user | Traders, news junkies | Goal-setters, fitness |

**GoalStake is the "bet on yourself" market. Polymarket is the "bet on others" market.**
